                <h2>Personas and Storyboarding</h2>
                <p>In this project, I analyzed the ice cream machine in my college hall and interviewed the people
                    who
                    used it. Using the interviews, I created personas for people who use the ice cream machine and
                    then
                    a storyboard where one of the personas interacts with the ice cream machine.</p>

                <h2>Responsive Redesign</h2>
                <p>In this project, I improve the previous Brown Ballroom Dance Team website by analyzing its usability
                    and functionality and redesigning it so that it is easier to use and works on many different device
                    sizes.</p>

                <h2>Iterative Design</h2>
                <p>In this project, I work with a team of students to create a design for a user interface for a start
                    up. Using the start ups description of their product as a guideline, we worked together to create a
                    possible version of a final user interface.</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>In this project, I used React to create a sortable and filterable list of items which could be
                    selected and added to an agregator.</p>
